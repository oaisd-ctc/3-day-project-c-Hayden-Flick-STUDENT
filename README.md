Generic RPG Combat System (henceforth referred to as "the game") is a half-game demonstrating the concept of a "turn-based combat system".

The game uses a command line input system to control a set of 3 player characters and an RNG system to control a set of 3 enemy characters. The goal of the game is for the player characters to defeat all the enemy characters. 

The win condition is when there are no computer-controlled enemies remaining. The loss condition is when there are no player-controlled characters remaining. If these conditions are both false, then the game is still in session.
